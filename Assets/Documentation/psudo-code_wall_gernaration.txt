Find number of walls (random number) between 1 and 3. 
Set safespace (SS) to value (2)
Find starting point (SP) on the map. 
    for each wall that should be placed 
        find the length of each wall (random number) between 2 and 5
        arrayOfPossibleDirections = []
        for each direction (north, south, east, west)
            check if the length of the wall + safespace (SP), don't hit another collider 
            if it does not hit collider  
                add that direction to arrayOfPossibleDirections
        find a random direction from the arrayOfPossibleDirections
        walk the direction until the length of wall is meet from the starting point. 
        Set the SP on the last placed tile.
